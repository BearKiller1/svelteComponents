general plans 
    (done)
    it must have some sort of trigger in the parent component 
    and by importing it u have access to open/close dialog

openIF={openDialog} (done -> bind:openIF={openBoolean} )

contentValue = fetch everythings value, (done)
    1. add binds to all the inputs and selectors
    2. it should bind it to the object with the same 
    name as elements id, so the user who defiend 
    the input in parent will have access on it
    buy giving child the variable he wishes to be
    filled with all the values.
    3. need to find how to acces all the elements in slots
    and fetch data from them + add this bind 
    (actualy i have to do this first and then second.)
    4. clear all this mess
@param
    id = string
    title = string (done)
    position = string (center is default for now) {
        'top'
        'bototm'
        'left'
        'right'
    }
    size = object {
        width 	= string | int
        height 	= string | int
    }
    style = object (pure css) {

    }

    draggable = boolean

@actions - what is has to do when opend 
    (done)
    onOpen 	= function
    onClose = function



@todos
    1. figure out hwo to add buttons to the dialog
        save
        cancel
        ...
    2. figure out how to fetch & insert data in dialog inputs/selector
